            A being known as “Calamity from the Skies” crashes into the Planet on a meteor, injuring the Planet. The Cetra come and heal the Planet. The Planet creates six powerful weapons to combat the Calamity but is never used. The Calamity of the Skies almost wipes out the Cetra race. The Cetra began to assimilate into human civilization while maintaining their ancient knowledge and powers.

         <br>
         <p>Zack checks on Sephiroth and he tells Zack what he has learned about the Ancients, their journey to heal the Planet, and how at the end of their journey, they would settle in the Promised Land, a land of supreme happiness. He blames the non-Cetran humans for stopping their migration and hiding after a disaster struck the Planet while the Cetra sacrificed themselves to save it. Still thinking Jenova is an Ancient and unaware of her being the disaster that struck the planet 2,000 years ago, Sephiroth tells Zack he was created from Jenova, and concludes he must be an Ancient. Sephiroth leaves the Shinra mansion to see his mother and sets fire to the town, killing many of the villagers, Cloud's mother being among those killed in Sephiroth's rampage. Zangan, Tifa's martial arts teacher, saves some of the people from the burning buildings. The Turk calls Tseng to tell him of this development as Sephiroth heads for the Mako Reactor. With Tseng saying he will arrive with backup, the Turk follows Sephiroth up Mt. Nibel to the reactor, and Tifa's father, Tifa, Zack and Cloud also make their way up separately. At the reactor, the Turk confronts Sephiroth, but is defeated. Sephiroth kills Tifa's father leaving his Masamune sword embedded in him. Tifa sees her father's body as she enters the reactor and takes up Sephiroth's sword, intent on killing Sephiroth. At the entrance to Jenova's chamber Tifa charges at Sephiroth, but is disarmed as Sephiroth reclaims his sword and cuts Tifa down, then enters the chamber. Zack arrives, forcing his way into Jenova's chamber as Sephiroth tears off the mechanical effigy attached to her containment tube. Sephiroth declares he will take back the Planet with her. Zack confronts Sephiroth but is defeated as Sephiroth lands a powerful blow that throws him out of the chamber. Cloud arrives and takes up Zack's Buster Sword and catches Sephiroth off guard, thrusting the sword into Sephiroth's back, then returns to the Turk and Tifa's aid. The weakened Sephiroth breaks into Jenova's containment tube and tears off her head. Zangan takes Tifa away while the Turk runs upstairs to Jenova's chamber as Sephiroth skewers Cloud with his Masamune. Cloud hurls both Sephiroth and his sword into the Mako pit below. The severely wounded Cloud collapses as the Turk comes to his side. The Turk calls Tseng, explaining Sephiroth is dead. In reality, Sephiroth remains alive within the Lifestream, able to maintain his individuality due to being created from Jenova. Seeing an opportunity to gain the knowledge and power of the Lifestream, Sephiroth starts plotting his revenge against the Planet. Hojo, Tseng, Reno, Rude, and Veld arrive to cover the events. The plan is to rebuild Nibelheim and populate it with Shinra employees. The surviving townspeople are to be used as test subjects in Hojo's new research project where he tests his Jenova Reunion Theory. The survivors include Zack and Cloud. While Veld and the Turk are in the Shinra Mansion destroying documents and testing the machines for Hojo's experiments, they fall victim to illusions created by the monsters in the mansion. Hojo tells the Turks to bring the survivors into the mansion for his experiments. Reno, Rude, Tseng, and the Turk are reluctant to do it, and Veld tales over the task. Zangan decides to take Tifa away from Nibelheim.</p>

         <p>The Turk arrives in Corel to stop AVALANCHE from destroying the Mako Reactor and meets a local Barret Wallace, informing him of the situation. Believing the reactor is Corel's future, Barret helps the Turk by using a shortcut through the mines to get to the reactor. The Turk parts ways with Barret at the reactor and is confronted by Rufus Shinra upon entering. Tseng, Reno, and Rude join the Turk as Veld appears, ordering them to apprehend the Vice President for conspiring with AVALANCHE. They are ambushed by AVALANCHE, and Fuhito tells Rufus he and his financial support are no longer needed, and orders his men to dispose of him and the Turks. The Turks fight off AVALANCHE and escape from the reactor while escorting Rufus. The Turks run into Elfé, Fuhito, and Shears and Veld recognizes Elfé as his daughter, Felicia. Veld leaves the Turks to pursue Elfé, an act of treason punishable by death. The Turks flee the reactor with Rufus, and as the reactor explodes, Fuhito pushes Shears into the reactor depths taking the Turk as they both fall.The Turk and Shears awake in the lowermost part of the reactor. They are surrounded by monsters and decide to call a temporary truce. Shears reveals Fuhito's ultimate goal: to destroy all life on the Planet, returning it to the Lifestream so it can live longer. He plans using the Materia implanted in the back of Elfé's hand. Shears wants to stop Fuhito so he may not do any more harm to Elfé. Shears helps the Turk to safety, but is too injured to do so himself. As the structure collapses, the Turk is knocked unconscious.To cover up AVALANCHE's resurgence Shinra blames the explosion on Corel, dispatching a Shinra Security unit, led by Scarlet, to attack the mining village. Barret and Dyne make their way back to the village but are attacked by Scarlet and the Shinra troops. Dyne falls off a cliff, Barret tries to pull him back up but his hand is shot and Dyne falls into the ravine. Barret is no longer able to use his right arm. Corel is burned to the ground and the survivors flee to North Corel.Barret digs through the Corel's rubble with only one working arm to look for survivors. He cannot find his wife, Myrna, nor Dyne's wife, Eleanor, but finds Dyne's daughter Marlene and decides to raise Marlene as his own daughter, swearing revenge against Shinra.

         ><p>Zack and Cloud have been held in Shinra Mansion for over four years, being subject to various experiments in injecting them with Jenova's cell's from Sephiroth. Zack, having already been exposed to Jenova cells when he joined SOLDIER, is unaffected making him useless for Hojo's experiment to test his Reunion Theory, while Cloud's body accepts them. Hojo is hopeful of Cloud's potential, but this is short-lived when Cloud's psyche collapses as he develops a severe Mako poisoning and is reduced to a catatonic state. Hojo labels him a failure and won't number him. Cloud and Zack are kept sedated in holding tubes, but one day Zack has a vision of Angeal, regains consciousness and breaks out of his holding tube. He releases the catatonic Cloud and gets Cloud a SOLDIER 1st Class uniform, fearing his old clothes are soaked with Mako. Zack decides to return to Midgar with Cloud.

Zack fights the Shinra infantrymen but is overwhelmed and the Shinra troops leave him to die. Cloud gains some awareness and comes to his side. Zack entrusts the Buster Sword to Cloud, telling him he is his living legacy, before dying. Cloud bids farewell to Zack and heads off toward Midgar.

         <p>Since the destruction of Corel, Barret, now with a gun-arm, has put together an anti-Shinra group made up of like-minded anti-Shinra sympathizers: Biggs, Wedge, Jessie, and Tifa. Having stumbled upon a former AVALANCHE hideout, Barret adopts the name although unlike their predecessors, this group's goal to destroy Shinra as opposed to the human race. In the hideout the new AVALANCHE finds plans for a bomb the old AVALANCHE made.
            Tifa finds Cloud wandering about in the Sector 7 Slums and is troubled by his strange behavior. Cloud claims he is a former SOLDIER 1st Class and, wanting to keep a close eye on him, Tifa invites him into AVALANCHE to work as a soldier-for-hire. The trauma he endured from watching his hometown burn, his Mako poisoning and seeing his friend die, has warped Cloud's mind and the presence of the Jenova cells has merged his memories with Zack's.

         <p>The AVALANCHE return to their hideout in Tifa's 7th Heaven bar, and plan to blow up Mako Reactor No. 5 while Cloud attempts to take his pay and leave. Tifa reminds Cloud of the promise he had made seven years ago, and he decides to stay for the next mission.
            AVALANCHE attacks Mako Reactor No. 5, and after planting the bomb, they are confronted by President Shinra and Cloud falls to the Sector 5 Slums as the Mako Reactor explodes.
            Cloud is awakened by Aerith and finds himself in the Sector 5 Church. Reno shows up with some Shinra infantrymen, intent on capturing Aerith. Cloud is hired as Aerith's bodyguard, and he helps her escape the church and returns her to her home in the Sector 5 Slums, although Aerith keeps from Cloud the truth about why she is being chased by the Turks. Aerith promises to take Cloud to Sector 7 in the morning but her adoptive mother, Elmyra, tells Cloud to leave early. Cloud and Aerith arrive to Sector 6 and spot a chocobo carriage carrying Tifa to Don Corneo's place in Wall Market, where Cloud and Aerith are denied entry as the Don only allows ladies. A disguised Cloud and Aerith infiltrate Don Corneo's Mansion and meet Tifa. The three confront Corneo who reveals Heidegger hired him to find out AVALANCHE's location and Shinra plans drop the Sector 7 Plate to destroy the terrorists. Corneo triggers a trapdoor and drops Cloud, Aerith and Tifa into the sewers. Cloud, Tifa, and Aerith arrive in Sector 7 where they find Shinra going through with the plan. Cloud sends Aerith to get Barret's daughter Marlene out of Sector 7, as he and Tifa catch up with Barret. Reno sets the pillar to detonate and Tseng captures Aerith after threatening to hurt Marlene if she doesn't cooperate. The pillar collapses and Cloud, Tifa, and Barret escape by a long wire pulley device into the Sector 6 Slums. Sector 7 Plate collapses, killing hundreds both on the plate and in the slums including Biggs, Wedge, Jessie, and Denzel's parents.
            Cloud, Tifa and Barret arrive at Aerith's house where they find Marlene. Elmyra tells the group Aerith is an Ancient whose powers the Shinra seeks to exploit. Barret entrusts Marlene in Elmyra's care as he accompanies Cloud and Tifa to rescue Aerith.
            Cloud's group uses the debris left from the Sector 7 destruction to climb onto the upper plate and infiltrates Shinra Headquarters where they spy on an executive meeting from the vents. Shinra plans to use Aerith to find the Promised Land believed to be rich in Mako Energy, where they want to build a new city, Neo-Midgar. Cloud's group see Hojo observing Nanaki and Cloud reacts to Jenova's body that had been moved from the Mt. Nibel Reactor into Shinra Headquarters. Hojo attempts to crossbreed Nanaki with Aerith, but Barret shoots at the containment unit freeing them. Nanaki introduces himself as Red XIII, the name Hojo gave to him, and joins in their escape, but they are caught by the Turks and locked away in the building's detention area. Aerith reveals she is unsure if the Promised Land exists.After five years of waiting while recovering his power, Sephiroth, who now resides in the Lifestream, calls out to Jenova's body at the Shinra Headquarters that comes to life and takes the form of Sephiroth himself. "Sephiroth" kills President Shinra, and escapes Midgar to Kalm. Cloud and the others find themselves released from their cells and find President Shinra dead. After Palmer, who had been hiding nearby, confirms Sephiroth did it, Rufus arrives by helicopter. Now the new President of the Shinra Electric Power Company, Rufus tells Cloud and his comrades plans on controlling the world through fear. After Rufus retreats, Cloud, Tifa, Barret, Aerith and Red XIII escape to KalmIn Gongaga the party runs into Reno and Rude who were expecting their arrival but they flee after losing the confrontation. Cloud suspects there may be a spy among them but decides to trust everyone. Scarlet and Tseng inspect the ruined Gongaga Reactor for Huge Materia but cannot find any. The party meets Zack's parents in the village who wonder of their son's whereabouts, upsetting Tifa and Aerith. The former still refuses to divulge the whole truth when questioned but Aerith tells Zack used to be her boyfriend.
            The buggy breaks down when the party passes Cosmo Canyon and they seek help in repairing it. Red XIII leaves the party saying he is home, and Bugenhagen tells the party of the spirit energy and the hazardous effect Shinra's drilling for Mako is having on the Planet. Aerith learns of her Cetra heritage and the Promised Land from the elders. Having learned Red XIII resents his "traitor" father Bugenhagen takes him to the Cave of the Gi to show him the truth. After the buggy is repaired Red XIII decides to continue accompanying the party on Bugenhagen's request.
            The party finds Nibelheim fully rebuilt with impostor villagers hired by Shinra posing as the villagers to cover up the town's destruction five years ago. The town is full of Sephiroth Clones, the former villagers whose minds have broken. They meet Sephiroth in the Shinra Manor basement who asks Cloud to follow him across the mountains to the Reunion.In west they find Wutai but are ambushed by Shinra soldiers. During the tussle they notice Yuffie has taken off with their Materia, although she insisted she is not collaborating with Shinra. They track her down in Wutai village where Reno, Rude and Elena are on vacation, but when the Shinra soldiers request their help in locating Don Corneo who has been spotted in the area, they refuse. The party corners Yuffie who explains she wanted their Materia to restore Wutai to its former glory, but takes off again after the party is trapped inside a cage. After freeing themselves the party discovers Yuffie and Elena have both been kidnapped by Don Corneo who has taken them to the Da Chao mountain, and Reno and Rude join forces with AVALANCHE to save them. Reno kicks Corneo off the Da Chao precipice and Yuffie returns the Materia and rejoins the party, thankful for having been rescued.
            Yuffie battles the five warriors of Wutai at the pagoda and discovers the top warrior is her father, Godo. After besting him in battle he admires her strength and asks her to keep accompanying the party, suggesting she steal their Materia again once Sephiroth has been dealt with.
            The party discovers they need the Keystone to enter the Temple of the Ancients where Sephiroth is said to be headed. Cloud acquires it from Dio of Gold Saucer but they are forced to stay the night when the ropeway breaks down. During the night Cait Sith steals the Keystone and hands it over to Tseng of the Turks. He is caught but because he has had Marlene taken hostage, the others allow him to keep accompanying them.
            In the temple the party finds Tseng injured by Sephiroth and he relinquishes the Keystone. At the heart of the temple the party meets Sephiroth who divulges his plan on summoning a Meteor to wound the Planet so he could absorb its spirit energy and become a god. As the temple itself is the Black Materia required to summon the Meteor, Cait Sith volunteers to sacrifice himself to get it. After the temple is shrunk a new Cait Sith appears to replace the old one, and Sephiroth takes control of Cloud to hand the Materia to him and to attack Aerith until a party member knocks him unconscious.
            In a dream Aerith tells Cloud she is heading to the Forgotten Capital to stop Sephiroth. Cloud awakes in Gongaga and tells the others and they decide to follow her.
            In the Bone Village the party digs up a Lunar Harp and passes through the Sleeping Forest to the Forgotten Capital. While staying the night Cloud awakes as he hears Aerith calling for him, and the party finds her on an altar praying. She is killed by Sephiroth who claims Cloud is nothing but a puppet, and a white Materia piece falls from her hair to the water below. The party mourns her passing and Cloud rests her in the lake, vowing to avenge her.
            The party follows Sephiroth's trail to Icicle Inn where they meet an angered Elena, thinking Tseng being injured was Cloud's party's fault. They find records left behind by Gast and Ifalna detailing the origins of Jenova, Weapons, and Aerith and Ifalna's capture by Shinra.
            All the Sephiroth Clones converge at the crater but are cut down by Sephiroth. When the party confronts him he transforms into Jenova-DEATH and is destroyed, leaving behind the Black Materia. Cloud realises who they had been pursuing wasn't the real Sephiroth but Jenova transformed into Sephiroth's image, but suspects the real Sephiroth is nearby. He gives the Black Materia to a party member to keep safe as he does not trust himself.
            Cloud and Tifa find themselves back in an illusionary Nibelheim Sephiroth has conjured. He tells Cloud never came to Nibelheim five years ago, but a man named Zack was there instead. When a distressed Tifa confirms this is the truth Cloud has a mental breakdown. Sephiroth tricks the party member holding the Black Materia into returning it to Cloud, and they all meet at the crater with Shinra. Cloud begs Hojo to number him but he is disgusted upon being addressed by a failed experiment. Cloud gives the Materia to Sephiroth's true body resting inside a Mako crystal and the Weapons that had been resting in the crater are awakened. The party and Shinra escape on the Highwind while Cloud falls into the Lifestream as the crater crumbles with the Weapons breaking free. Tifa is knocked unconscious as the Highwind comes near Ultimate Weapon.</p>
